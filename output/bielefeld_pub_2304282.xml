                    <abstract lang="eng">A characterisation of Scottish identity and nationalism in the mid-nineteenth century as proposed by many scholars from the modernist school is inappropriate: it ignores the cultural and historical dimension of Scottish nationalism. By identifying the problems of the modernist approach, this thesis develops a comprehensive conceptualisation of identity and nationalism. It is based on a model of concentric loyalties and incorporates the nation&apos;s history, ethnie and culture, thus providing a new framework for the study of Scottish identity and nationalism in the mid-nineteenth century that lies outside of the &quot;political&quot;.
Despite the initial hostility of many Scots to the Union, it helped to maintain a substantial degree of Scottish autonomy which, combined with the disintegration of the Jacobite threat after the rebellion of 1745, the threat posed by &quot;the Other&quot; and the material benefits the Union eventually brought, helped silence anti-Union protest and facilitated the emergence of a new &quot;Britishness&quot;. But Scottish distinctiveness was never lost. Apart from the traditional pillars of Scottish society that continued to underpin Scottish identity, it was the Scots&apos; participation in the Empire that became central to the continuous construction of &quot;Scottishness&quot;. The imperial partnership facilitated the creation of a form of popular imperialism that shaped Scottish identity within an essentially British frame: the Empire helped to preserve Scottish national identity in the British state and was, thus, a central factor of reconciliation with the Union.
Within this context, the thesis investigates in a case study how the &quot;National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights&quot; interpreted the Scottish nation, its culture and its history; the NAVSR was chosen because it was the first coherent Scottish national movement. The study of the NAVSR shows how nationalist arguments were developed within a unionist frame, i.e. a pronounced loyalty to the Union of 1707, the British state and the Empire, without neglecting Scottish distinctiveness.
The thesis concludes that the NAVSR could use the Scots&apos; dual identity (to both the British state and the Scottish nation) to assert a successful Scottish mid-nineteenth century nationalism in the form of the apparent oxymoron of &quot;unionist nationalism&quot; for which the imperial partnership, a positive interpretation of Scottish history, the nation&apos;s myths and culture were crucial.</abstract>
