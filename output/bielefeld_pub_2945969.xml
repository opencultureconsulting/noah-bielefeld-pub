                    <abstract lang="eng">OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the subjective employment perspective in higher working age for different employee groups with migrant background (EMB) and without (non-EMB), meaning willing, being able, and planning to work until the individual state pension age (iSPA).; METHODS: A representative sample of socially insured employees born in 1959 or 1965 was surveyed in 2011, 2014, and 2018 with computer-assisted personal interviews. The current cross-sectional analysis is based on data from the third study wave (n=3286) of the lidA cohort study. EMB were differentiated via generation (first generation, G1, vs second generation, G2) or nationality (German vs foreign). Applying bivariate statistics with the tests of independence and block-wise logistic regressions, group differences were investigated. Sex, age, educational level, net household income, health, and work factors were considered as covariates.; RESULTS: When comparing subgroups of EMB, significant differences appeared in bivariate analyses for willing and planning to work. G1 were to a higher degree planning to work longer than G2 and those with foreign nationality were more willing and planning than those with German nationality. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences of G1 and non-EMB for planning, being significant in the fully adjusted model, but not for willing.; CONCLUSION: The findings underline the need for differentiation of migrant groups in social research and policy. When it comes to extended working lives, the first-generation migrant group, as well as foreigners may constitute risk groups and require increased attention from a work, health, and economic point of view. © 2020 The Authors.
