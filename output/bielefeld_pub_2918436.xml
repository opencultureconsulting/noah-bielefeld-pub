                    <abstract lang="eng">The frequency and intensity of natural disasters from climate events have been increasing in
the last few years. While scientists are careful in causally linking these natural disasters to
climate change, the record-breaking extreme climate events such as typhoon Haiyan in the
Philippines speak for itself. Formerly a laggard in climate talks, adaptation has now gained
footing not just in the UNFCCC but also among different countries. Decision 1/CP.16 also
known as The Cancun Agreements invites all parties to the UNFCCC to enhance action on
adaptation and undertake measures with regard to climate change induced displacement
and migration. It is exactly this COP decision, which motivated the governments of Norway
and Switzerland to establish the Nansen Initiative and craft a protection agenda for people
who are at risk of disaster-induced cross-border displacement. Despite these efforts, there
has yet to be a legally binding migration treaty that climate change victims can invoke. In this
paper, we will look into the feasibility of immigration opportunities as humanitarian aid for
victims of extreme climate events. Inspired by US and Canada immigration relief measures
for typhoon Haiyan victims in the Philippines, we use a socio-political approach in constructing
an immigration humanitarian model, which we would like to recommend as a potential
humanitarian intervention after climate disasters. This recommendation is not only intended
to address UNFCCCâ€™s Decision 2/CP.19 (the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and
Damage) but to also provoke ambition and compassion from countries that are historically
responsible for climate change.</abstract>
