                    <abstract lang="eng">To emulate the movement agility and adaptiveness of stick insects in technical systems such as piezo actuators (Szufnarowski et al. 2014) or hexapod robots (Schneider, Cruse et al. 2006), a direct adaptation of bioinspired walking controllers like WALKNET has often been suggested. However, stick insects have very specific features such as adhesive foot pads that allow them to cling to the ground. Typically, robots do not possess such features. Besides, robots tend to be bigger and heavier than their biological models, usually possessing a different mass distribution as well. This leads to different mechanical and functional properties that need to be addressed in control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the model of the stick insect *Carausius morosus*, the six-legged robot HECTOR was developed in this work to test and evaluate bioinspired controllers. The robot&apos;s geometrical layout corresponds to that of the stick insect, scaled up by a factor of 20. Moreover, like the stick insect, the robot features an inherent compliance in its joints. This compliance facilitates walking in uneven terrain since small irregularities can be compensated passively without controller intervention. However, the robot differs from the biological model, e.g., in terms of its size, mass, and mass distribution. Also, it does not possess any means to cling to the ground and therefore must maintain static stability to avoid tilting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To evaluate the ability of stick insects to maintain static stability, experimental data (published by Theunissen et al. (2014)) was examined. It can be shown that stick insects do not maintain static stability at all times. Still, due to their adhesive foot pads, they do not tumble. Therefore, a direct replication of the biological walking controller would not be suitable for the control of HECTOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a next step, the bioinspired walking controller WALKNET (Cruse, Kindermann, et al. 1998) was evaluated regarding its applicability for the control of HECTOR. For this purpose, different parametrizations of WALKNET were tested in a simulation environment. For forward walking, parameter sets were found that achieve a high, although not permanent stability. Thus, for the control of HECTOR, which requires continuous stability, a more abstract adaption of the bioinspired coordination had to be found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the original coordination concepts of WALKNET, new coordination mechanisms were developed that incorporate the technical requirements (static stability, angular joint limits, torque constraints, etc.). The ability of the resulting controller to generate insect-like gaits is demonstrated for different walking scenarios in simulation. Moreover, locomotion that is unlikely for insects such as backwards and sidewards walking is shown to be feasible using the novel control approach. At the end of this work the applicability of the approach for the control of the real robot is proved in experiments on visual collision avoidance and basic climbing ability.</abstract>
