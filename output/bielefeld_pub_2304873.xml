                    <abstract lang="eng">Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of present generation while not compromising the ability of future generations to also meet their needs. There are 2 cases of sustainability. Case-1 is due to the discrepancy of environment and Case-2 is due to the change of environment. User, usage context and cultural aspects play important roles in the sustainability of system. Different groups of user response differently to the same system. Understanding the cultural consequence contributes to better sustainability of a system.
A sustainable system always attempts to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by system. A service - a meaningful set of capabilities provided by an existing or intended set of system to all who utilize it: subscribers, end users, network providers, and service providers - each seeing a different perspective of service. The definition, parameters and technologies of QoS are determined by level of QoS domain. The level model is defined with respect to design approach used in the level. Those levels are: QoS in infrastructure, QoS in network level, Software quality as QoS, Usability as QoS, Culturability, Acceptability and Actability.
The Lightweight Why-Because Analysis (LWBA) as an extension of Why-Because Analysis (WBA) is introduced as a tool for sustainable system development. LWBA is a semi-formal analysis, that investigates constraints in a non-judgmental manner. LWBA is also used to understand the needs of new development method which focus on sustainability. The analysis covers also non technical aspects, such as human resource, regulation and organization. LWBA is also employed as an investigative tool during the ethnography studies, a development tool in the proposed development method, and also as an explanation and a communication tool.
A novel development named as Bandung Bandowoso System Development Method (BBSDM) is introduced. The name is referred to a particular class of project in an extreme condition with many constraints that is culturally widely accepted in Indonesia. This system development method is formalized by actively involving in the real development projects for public. The BBSDM is commenced by requirement elicitation and analysis which is triggered by Case-1 or Case-2 sustainability problems, as well as from examples provided by stakeholders. The next phase is service specification and also the organizational and learning strategy specification. Service refinement is employed during the implementation phase. Then, the service evaluation and sustainability analysis. The LWBA with the Lightweight Why Because Graph (LWBG) as the representation tool are used in the entire life cycle of BBSDM.
As proof of the proposed development method, the development of real projects which employ BBSDM are described. Those projects are: Indonesia localization in Distro WinBI, the Air Putih in Tsunami relief action activities, the development of Early Warning Information System (EWIS) in Indonesia, and development as well as operation of critical web site of President of Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The systems are developed with many constraints and limitations in a very short time. By employing the BBSDM, the systems can sustain and still provide the expected services.
The participatory action research is chosen to develop the BBSDM and by utilizing Internet as research tool to perform the ethnography study. The make use of LWBA as analytical tool in this research methodology is also a contribution as a new way in performing action research.</abstract>
