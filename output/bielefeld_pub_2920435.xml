                    <abstract lang="eng">The aim of this thesis was the development of smart, thermoresponsive surface coatings
based on poly(*N*-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgels for applications in
biological and medical research. In order to understand microgel behavior when
deposited on a surface the physical properties and the morphology of adsorbed microgels
had to be studied and understood.&lt;br /&gt;
Initial experiments using atomic force microscopy (AFM) aimed at the characterization
of various microgels adsorbed and dried on a surface in order to gain
knowledge about the influence of the microgel architecture on their behavior. Further
experiments were conducted to examine the deposition behavior of microgels
when deposited with standard coating procedures such as spin-coating, dip-coating
and spray-coating. Results from these experiments were used to optimize these
processes for the manufacturing of microgel monolayers. In the course of a BMBF
funded project the obtained results were utilized to develop wound healing essays
for medical applications in cooperation with the institutes Fraunhofer IZI, Fraunhofer
IAT, the University Bayreuth and the companies Ibidi GmbH and PolyAn
GmbH.&lt;br /&gt;
Results and insights gained from this cooperation led to the idea to develop
transfereable thermoresponsive coatings. The principle idea was to cross-link the
microgels in a monolayer in order to obtain a free-standing, thermoresponsive film
which than can be deposited on various substrates and surfaces. In order to be able
to cross-link the microgel the thermoresponsive monomer NIPAM was copolymerized
with the monomer *N*-Benzhydrylacrylamide (NBHAM). The aromatic moieties
of the monomer NBHAM enabled the possibility to cross-link the microgels in a
monolayer using an electron beam. The cross-linked layer could than be detached
from the initial substrate and transferred to any arbitrary substrate. Furthermore it is
possible to use the free-standing microgel film as a temperature controllable membrane.
In conductivity measurements it has been shown that the resistivity of the
membrane can be tuned by changing the external temperature.</abstract>
