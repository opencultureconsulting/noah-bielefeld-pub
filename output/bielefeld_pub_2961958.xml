                    <abstract lang="eng">The applicability of robots significantly changed over the last years. Instead of static
environments in the industry, robots are utilized in highly dynamic environments.
Additionally, the interaction between humans and robots emerged as an important
factor for the applicability of robots in personal environments. While considerable
research was already invested to allow for more natural interactions with robots,
errors occur regularly. Besides technical failures of the robot, human-induced mistakes
greatly affect occurring problems. These mistakes can be ascribed to the unfunctional
mental model naive users have about robots. In this context, an unfunctional mental
model denotes false expectations of the functionality of a robot.
This thesis tackles the problem of erroneous interactions by shaping functional
mental models. The main hypothesis is that through more accurate assumptions about
the functionality of robots, users will induce fewer errors in interactions. Towards this,
approaches to convey the technical concepts of the robot are investigated. In a first
step, I discuss the current literature on Human-Robot Interaction. A particular focus
is on factors that influence usersâ€™ mental models of robots. Furthermore, approaches
to increase robot transparency are presented.
Based on this background, I investigate the effects of instruction videos and process
visualizations on the mental model in an online user study. From the analysis of this
study, I present the development of a transparent robot control architecture called
FunctionAl user Mental model by Increased LegIbility ARchitecture (FAMILIAR).
This control architecture aims at increased transparency and comprehensibility for
naive users. I further investigate in a second study how dynamic visualizations and a
visual programming approach can improve knowledge about the control architecture.
The studies reveal that 1) the combination of an instruction video and a process
visualization improves the mental model most successfully, 2) technical concepts of
robots differ in terms of familiarity and perceivability, 3) functional mental models
about robots improve Human-Robot Interaction. Additionally, observations regarding
the negative impact anthropomorphization has on successful interactions is discussed.</abstract>
