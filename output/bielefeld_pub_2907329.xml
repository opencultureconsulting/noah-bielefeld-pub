This thesis contributes to the economic theory literature in three aspects: price dynamics in financial
markets with asymmetric information, belief updating and equilibrium refinements in signalling
games, and introducing ambiguity in limit pricing theory.&lt;br /&gt;
In chapter 2, we formulate a zero-sum trading game between a better informed sector and a less
informed sector to endogenously determine the underlying price dynamics. In this model, player 1
is informed of the state (L) but is uncertain about player 2&apos;s belief about the state, because player 2
is informed through some message (M) related to the state. If L and M are independent, then the
price process will be a Continuous Martingale of Maximal Variation (CMMV), and player 1 can
benefit from his informational advantage. However, if L and M are not independent, player 1 will
not reveal his information during the trading process, therefore, he does not benefit from his
informational advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
In chapter 3, I propose a definition of Hypothesis Testing Equilibrium (HTE) for general signalling
games with non-Bayesian players nested by an updating rule according to the Hypothesis Testing
model characterized by Ortoleva (2012). An HTE may differ from a sequential Nash equilibrium
because of dynamic inconsistency. However, in the case in which player 2 only treats a zeroprobability
message as an unexpected news, an HTE is a refinement of sequential Nash equilibrium
and survives the Intuitive Criterion in general signalling games but not vice versa. We provide an
existence theorem covering a broad class of signalling games often studied in economics.&lt;br /&gt;
In chapter 4, I introduce ambiguity in a standard industry organization model, in which the
established firm is either informed of the true state of aggregate demand or is under classical
measurable uncertainty about the state, while the potential entrant is under Knightian uncertainty
(ambiguity) about the state. I characterize the conditions under which limit pricing emerges in
equilibria, and thus ambiguity decreases the probability of entry. Welfare analysis shows that limit
pricing is more harmful in a market with higher expected demand than in a market with lower
expected demand.</abstract>
